The IPL or Intial Program Loader, loads the kernel module.
The IPL is loaded by the Pre-IPL at 0x500.
The IPL uses 0x4500 for loading the root directory and FATs of the FAT12 filesystem. 
So the IPL can't be bigger than 16KB.
The IPL starts in 16 bit realmode, loads the kernel at 0x10000. 
So the kernel module has to be smaller than 448KB.
The IPL also enables A20 to access all the memory and sets up GDT and finaly jumps in to protected mode.
Finaly the IPL copies the kernel image to 0x100000, parses the module, and then it calls the main.
