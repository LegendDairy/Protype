Protype is an x86-based microkernel mostly written in C. 
The microkernel has it's own two stage bootloader (i.e. the Pre-IPL and IPL).
The kernel is written in C and x86-assembler.
I will try to add documentation in the DOCS folders for every part of the microkernel to clarify the code.

Current realease number: r1,00 codenamed Hydrogen

/bin  : Contains the Floppy image
/boot : Contains Pre-IPL code, i.e. stage 1 of the bootloader
/ipl  : Contains the IPL code, i.e. stage 2 of the bootloader
