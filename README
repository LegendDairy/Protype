Protype is an x86_64-based microkernel mostly written in C. 
The microkernel has it's own two stage bootloader (i.e. the Pre-IPL and IPL).
The kernel is written in C and x86-assembler.
I will try to add documentation in the DOCS folders for every part of the microkernel to clarify the code.

The goal is to write a lightweight and fast kernel and use all the options that the x86_64 platform has to offer.
The code is not meant to be portable at all because that would either overcomplicate things or make the code slow.
The kernel will support Long Mode and SMP, in fact it demands support for Long Mode and features like an IOAPIC.
The target cpu is a 2600k

Future Ideas:
-unmap pages arround the stack to detect stack overruns
-Possibility to allign heap structures
-mutex the shit out of mem-managers!


Current realease number: r1,3 codenamed Hydrogen

/bin  :   Contains the binaries, i.e. the Floppy image, modules...
/boot :   Contains Pre-IPL code, i.e. stage 1 of the bootloader
/ipl  :   Contains the IPL code, i.e. stage 2 of the bootloader
/kernel:  Contains the actual kernel, mainly in C


To build the kernel, you can use the build.sh script, irst you'll need to give it per;ission on Linux:
chmod 777 build.sh
Then you can run it, if you copy to Protype folder to your home directory
./build.sh
To test:
bochs -q -f bin/bochsrc.txt


Tools:
GNU gcc crosscompiler with x86_64-elf as target
NASM Netwide Assembler, that came with my distribution
Bochs with GUI Debugger

I wrote most of the code myself, but I also took some code from the internet, because I was to lazy to write it. 
For example the printscreen code.
