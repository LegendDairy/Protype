Protype is an x86_64-based microkernel mostly written in C. 
The microkernel has it's own two stage bootloader (i.e. the Pre-IPL and IPL). The kernel is written in C and x86-assembler.
I will try to add documentation in the DOCS folders for every part of the microkernel to clarify the code.

The goal is to write a lightweight and fast kernel and use most of the features that the x86_64 platform has to offer.
The code is not meant to be portable at all because that would either overcomplicate things or make the code slow.
The kernel will support Long Mode and SMP, in fact it demands support for Long Mode and features like an IOAPIC, SSE.
The target cpu is a 2600k

Current realease number: r1,3 codenamed Hydrogen

/bin  :   Contains the binaries, i.e. the Floppy image, modules...
/boot :   Contains Pre-IPL code, i.e. stage 1 of the bootloader
/ipl  :   Contains the IPL code, i.e. stage 2 of the bootloader
/kernel:  Contains the actual kernel, mainly in C


To build the kernel, you can use the build.sh script, first you'll need to give it permission on Linux:
chmod 777 build.sh
chmod 777 ipl/build.sh
chmod 777 boot/build.sh
Then you can run it, if you copy to Protype folder to your home directory
./build.sh

Tools:
GNU GCC Crosscompiler with x86_64-ELF target
NASM Netwide Assembler

I wrote most of the code myself, but I also took some code from the internet, because I was to lazy to write it. 
For example the print to screen code (text.c), as this is only a debug feature.
